This C program prompts the user to enter a city for which they want to get the weather information. It then uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather data for the given city, parses the JSON response to extract the relevant weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover), and displays that data to the user in a user-friendly format.
